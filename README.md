# Webgram :computer:

Webgram is an Instagram-like website where users start by signing in, or registering in case they do not have an account. Once completed, they will be redirected to a page where they can surf the feed to view other users posted pictures. In addition, they can post/delete their own pictures, like and comment posts, and hide their pictures from other users.
